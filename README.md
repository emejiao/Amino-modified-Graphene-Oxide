# Amino-modified-Graphene-Oxide
## Generation of topologies of graphene oxide functionalized with alkylamines
This repository have a script to build the amino-modified models of GO, the nucleophilic ring-opening reaction mechanism between the N-alkylamines and epoxy functional groups was considered. Reaction between the N-alkylamines and epoxy groups yields the corresponding a-amino alcohols. Random addition of the N-alkylamine molecules on the GO model and topological file generation were performed by using python software
